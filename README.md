Anyone Editing the level: work one at a time and update each other when you 'checking it out' and working on in

Anyone Editing the movie sequence: only save and push the sequencer, not the whole file

Anyone with a Mac: Don't push Mac only files

Everyone: Don't fuck up. If it does get messed up, alert everyone in the Discord to the issue and go back in the history for an older save of the file
